			<p><strong><font size="4">Rock music became a huge cultural force when it entered the musical scene in the 1950s, influencing fashion, human behavior, and cultural norms ever since.Her Traditionally, rock music has been especially popular among younger adults and teenagers. The music was associated with rebellion and youth. In 2017, however, for the first time, R &B and hip-hop became the most dominant genre in the US, according to Nielsen Music, surpassing rock music. Yet while many have turned their backs on the genre, and the list contains relatively fewer recent acts compared with the more established, classic rock bands, rock and roll is still alive and well.Here I writing about some up leading music band to me.</font></strong></p></br></br>

			<p style=color:white;background-color:#003153><font size="5">Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining a following as a psychedelic pop group, they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, and became a leading band of the progressive rock genre. Pink Floyd were one of the first British psychedelia groups, and are credited with influencing genres such as neo-progressive rock and ambient music.

			Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak of critical and commercial success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979). The Waters-written musical film based on The Wall album, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards.</font></P>

		<h2 id="thedoors"><span style=background-color:black;color:white><b>2.The Doors</b></span></h2>
		<img src="image/the doors.jpg" alt="The doors image">
			<p style=color:white;background-color:#7F00FF> <font size="5">The Doors began with a meeting between acquaintances Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, both of whom had attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, on Venice Beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs. Morrison said: "I was taking notes at a fantastic rock'n'roll concert going on in my head"[17] and with Manzarek's encouragement sang "Moonlight Drive". The members came from a varied musical background of jazz, rock, blues, and folk idioms.[18]
			Keyboardist Manzarek was in a band called Rick & the Ravens with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes.[19] In August 1965, Densmore joined the group, which had been renamed the Doors. The five (Morrison having previously joined the band), along with bass player Patty Sullivan[nb 1] recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965 at World Pacific Studios, Los Angeles, California (officially made available much later in October 1997 on the Doors' Box Set CD release). This has circulated widely since then as a bootleg recording. The band took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself derived from a line in William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite".[20] In mid-1965, after Manzarek's two brothers left, guitarist Robby Krieger joined.[21]</font></p>

			<p style=color:white;background-color:#800020><font size="5">Moheener Ghoraguli (Bengali: মহীনের ঘোড়াগুলি, literally "Moheen's Horses") was a Bengali independent music group from Kolkata, established in 1975.[1] Their music drew from wide variety of influences, including Bengali folk, Baul, urban American folk, and jazz.[1][2] They sometimes described their style as "Baul jazz."[2][3][4]
			Established in the 1970s during a period of stagnation in Bengali music, when commercial film songs were the dominant market force, the lyrics and music(and to some extent the compositions) of Moheener Ghoraguli with its leader Gautam Chattopadhyay were radically new. They were of a very personal or social nature, similar to the urban folk movement led by Bob Dylan in the 60s.[5] Though they were almost unknown in their time, in recent years they have undergone a critical re-evaluation much like the Velvet Underground. The band disbanded in 1981.
			In the 1990s, Gautam released a compilation of "Moheener Ghoraguli Sampadito" albums, in which there were songs written and composed by Gautam Chattopadhyay himself, songs by contemporary artistes and a few old songs of Moheener Ghoraguli The albums Aabaar Bochhor Kuri Pore in 1995. Jhara shomoyer gaan 1996. Maya in 1998 and Khepar Gaan in 1999.</font></p>

		<h2 id="thesmiths"><span style=background-color:black;color:white><b>5.The Smiths</b></span></h2>
		<img src="image/the smiths.jpg" width="800" height="400" alt="The smiths image">
		<p style=background-color:#92000A;color:#F5F5DC><font size="5">The Smiths were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1982. Consisting of vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, bassist Andy Rourke, and drummer Mike Joyce, critics consider the band one of the most important to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. Internal tensions led to their break up in 1987 and subsequent offers to reunite have been refused.[5] In 2012, all four Smiths' studio albums (and a compilation) appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time", while "William, It Was Really Nothing" and "How Soon Is Now?" were included in the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time" list.
		Based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk, were a rejection of the synthesiser-based dance-pop of the time. Marr's Rickenbacker guitar work was reminiscent of the jangle pop sound of Roger McGuinn from the Byrds.[6] Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes of ordinary lives with mordant humour.The Smiths were signed to the independent label Rough Trade Records. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart and all of their studio albums reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, including the number-one album Meat Is Murder (1985). They achieved mainstream success in Europe with The Queen Is Dead (1986) and Strangeways, Here We Come (1987), both of which entered the top twenty of the European Albums Chart.[7] Their live album Rank (1988) reached the top 10 in Europe.</font></p>
